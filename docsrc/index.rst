Meaningful Interaction for Analysis: Altair Express
======================================

<Insert Gallery Here> 
`Inspiration from Rive Gallery <https://rive.app/community/>`_


Altair express is a high-level data visualization library to make
interactive data analysis easier. In Altair Express 
(referred to as **alx**) creating an interactive chart can be done
in one function call; however, users can customize the interactive behavior 
:ref:`interaction-typology`. To bridge the gap between the
visualization and your analysis, we provide the ability to copy
your interactions into pandas commands such as filter or group
by.
This library is meant to serve as a prototype for further
development and to better study how easy interaction
specification affects analysis patterns.
